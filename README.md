# Image-Dataset-Making

Here we will make out own image dataset by either preprocessing some other datasets or by using other techniques. Lets start creating the datasets.

You can download CelebA Dataset from this (https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) link.

1. Gender Detection Dataset Making from CelebA dataset of 200K Celebrity Faces. This Program is specifically used to use the dataset for Deep Learning. And you'll get the output dataset in the format as Train, Test and Validation directories separately.

2. Bald Detection Dataset Making from CelebA dataset of 200K Celebrity Faces. Here you'll also get the output in the same format as the previous Gender Detection dataset but here instead of Male and Female directories. We'll have Bald and NotBald Directories.

Make sure to run this program in the same directory where you've downloaded CelebA dataset by Jessica Li on https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset.
